&nbsp;</div>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GUEST PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING</strong></h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
If you have asked us for accommodation, we need your personal data to address the appropriate offer to you and forward it to you. In most cases, this is your first and last name and your e-mail address and/or telephone number, but there is a possibility that we will ask you for additional information in order to adapt our offer to your needs and expectations, such as the number of children traveling with you or the language in which you want us to send you the offer. Only authorized employees of our sales department have access to the data. When you decide to accept our offer and book accommodation, we may need additional information for your identification upon arrival and payment security in accordance with our general terms and conditions. After the reservation has been made and on the day of your arrival, access to your data will be provided to authorized persons at our reception. When you book accommodation through our websites, we collect your basic information such as name, email address, telephone number and payment information. This data is used exclusively to process your reservation and provide accommodation services during your stay. Payment data, i.e. your card data, is encrypted and stored exclusively in systems that comply with PS DSS standards that regulate secure payment. If you contacted us by phone or via chat, the conversation with you remains recorded in our call center based on our legitimate interest in the safe processing of your inquiry, the control of our sales employees and the improvement of their work. Data from the call center is processed by authorized employees of our sales department. Medora has ongoing contracts with other, frequently used online sales channels, through which it advertises its available accommodation capacities and current offers, for example:<br>
- www.booking.com, operated by Booking.com, Herengracht 597, Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br>
- www.expedia.com, operated by Expedia Lodging Partner Services Sar, Geneva 1207, Switzerland.<br>
If you booked your stay in Medora through some of the partner sales channels and not directly with us (in communication by phone or email with our sales staff, directly at the reception desks of some of our facilities or on our website), Medora cannot influence the types of personal data that these online agencies are looking for you for the purposes of registering you as their user, nor the details of the processing of your data by them. From these websites, Medora processes and receives only the data necessary to make the correct accommodation reservation in our systems as stated above. When you, as a guest, come to one of our facilities, the laws governing the hospitality industry oblige us to collect legally defined personal data from each guest. In the event that the guest does not provide the minimum information required for guest registration in all relevant registers, we will not be able to provide accommodation services in accordance with the contract and the law. The personal data collected for this purpose by our authorized employees at the reception are:</div>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">name and surname</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">residential address</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">date of birth</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">number, type of identification document and place of issue</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">citizenship</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">the name of the facility where you are staying</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">accommodation unit number</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">date of arrival and departure of the guest</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">gender</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<br>
Medora stores the above data in its guest database and, in accordance with the legal obligation, sends it to the E-visitor system (electronic system for guest registration) to the competent authorities of the Republic of Croatia, and the above data must be kept in the system for 10 years.<br>
For the purposes of collecting the contract with the guest in accordance with the general terms of business, if payment is not made in cash, data on the account number from which the advance payment was received or data on the debited card are processed. In order to protect our guests as much as possible, your credit card number, which you have entered into the reservation system on our website as a payment guarantee or which we will debit for payment purposes, is recorded in our system in its entirety only until the end of your stay with us and is visible a minimum and strictly defined number of responsible employees. The system we use complies with the highest standard for payment security, the PS DSS standard. After the service has been charged, your card number is masked for further processing in such a way that certain numbers are replaced by an X, and this is also printed on your invoice or payment confirmation. If payment is made by card, your card number is processed exclusively on verified and secure POS devices certified by leading card companies.<br>
In accordance with legal regulations, Medora is obliged to keep all invoices issued to guests with the guest&#39;s personal data for 11 years.<br>
Other data related to the circumstances of your stay, such as: method of travel, who you are traveling with, marital status, number of children, pets, food allergies and other interests, will also be collected if they are directly related to the provision of our services. For example if you are traveling by car and want to park it during your stay in one of our designated parking lots or enter the camp with it unhindered, we will also need your vehicle&#39;s registration plate. Also, if you ask us to organize transportation for you from/to the airport or to another desired destination, or buy an excursion or other arrangement from our offer, your interests and requests will be recorded in our systems, and your data will be forwarded to one of our external associates with the aim of providing the requested services.</div>

Only data that is necessary in accordance with our legal obligations (minimum amount of data prescribed by law) is stored for a longer period. This does not apply to sensitive card payment data that is processed in the system in the manner described above. You can object to the data we process based on our legitimate interest at any time at privacy@medorahotels.com.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If, for the purposes of sending an offer or booking an accommodation, we communicated with you by e-mail, or you gave us your address during a telephone conversation, online correspondence with our staff, registration at our reception desks, participation in prize games or filling out a customer satisfaction survey e-mail as your personal data, Medora&#39;s marketing team may occasionally contact you via it. It is our desire that you come back to us again and be our guest again, and with this goal in mind, and to enable you to receive notifications about our special promotions and discounts related to our services, we reserve our legitimate interest to occasionally contact you at your e-mail address. The information you will receive will refer exclusively to the services offered by Medora, which we believe you, as our client, are still interested in. Medora may also introduce a new channel for sending notifications, such as social networks or online advertising, based on our legitimate interest or if we receive your consent. If we made a mistake and you do not want to receive our notifications, you can file a complaint at privacy@medorahotels.com at any time, and we will stop sending them without delay. Personal data are processed in the system we use to send notifications for 5 years, and contain your first and last name, and your e-mail address.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the safety of our guests and employees, but also in accordance with our legal obligations under the Act on Occupational Safety and the Act on the Protection of Financial Institutions, Medora&#39;s business and hospitality facilities are monitored by a video surveillance system and an access control system.
